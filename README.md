# Baseball_Aggressive_Analytics
A data analytics project that implements statistical concepts on a large data set to prove that players have become more aggressive over time.

This project implements a data set from Kaggle.com.  Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/baseball-databank?select=Batting.csv.
I used the Batting.csv file from the Data Explorer tab for my project.
